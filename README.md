# Online-Portal
Online study material portal is a dynamic website developed to make study materials accessible to everyone. It emphasizes on having a record of notes given each year for a particular subject. The subject handling staff being as an admin, uploads the desired notes in the site which can be later viewed in both user and admin ends. This facilitates the students with all the notes given by their respective staffs. To create this website we have used Html ,CSS and Bootstrap is used to design the front end , Php is used for backend queries and Mysql is used as a database. 
The reason for developing this online site is to eliminate the process of collecting each student’s email ids and adding the same to a google classroom which is a tedious process. This site being quite simple such that, once the notes from admin side is uploaded any student can access it .Thus this project is time efficient and helpful for student’s carrier.
